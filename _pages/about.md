I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Wesleyan University. I received my Ph.D. in political science from the University of São Paulo in 2021. I also hold a master’s degree in political science and a BA in social science. My primary fields of interest are public policy, public opinion, and political methodology. In my dissertation, I primarily focused on the study of elections and economic voting in comparative politics. I investigated the relationship between the decline in party loyalty and the advantage held by incumbent candidates in the United States House elections over time. I also adopted a comparative research approach to examine the gender gap in the approval ratings of the presidents in Brazil and the United States during the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. From 2017 to 2018, I was a visiting student at the political science department at Texas A&M University. In addition to my work as a research fellow, I also teach a course on Survey Design and Analysis at the Hazel Quantitative Analysis Center.
